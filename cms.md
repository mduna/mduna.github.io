## Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services 42 CFR Parts 417, 422, 423, and 460
[CMS–4208–P RIN 0938–AV40](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2024-12-10/pdf/2024-27939.pdf)

### Purpose
The primary purpose of this proposed rule is to amend the regulations for theMedicare Advantage (Part C) program, Medicare Prescription Drug Benefit (PartD) program, Medicaid program,
Medicare cost plan program, and Programs of All-Inclusive Care for the Elderly (PACE). This proposed rule includes a number of new policies that would improve these programs for
contract year 2026 as well as codify existing Part C and Part D subregulatory guidance.  

We note that, as with previous rules, the new marketing and communications policies in this rule are proposed to be applicable for all contract year 2026 marketing and communications,
beginning October 1, 2025. However, to operationalize the proposed Format Provider Directories for Medicare Plan Finder provision at § 422.111(m), we anticipate that 2025 plan year directory data will need to be made available online for testing purposes in the summer of 2025, and 2026 plan year data would need to be available online on October 1, 2026. Therefore, we propose an applicability date of July 1, 2025, for this provision.

### Number 5 Key Provision: Promoting Informed Choice—Format Provider Directories for Medicare Plan Finder 
CMS is proposing to require MA provider directory data, as required under § 422.111(b)(3)(i) be submitted for use to populate Medicare Plan Finder (MPF). In addition, CMS is proposing to require MA organizations to attest that this information is accurate and consistent with data submitted to comply with CMS’s MA network adequacy requirements at 
[422.116(a)(1)(i)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-42/chapter-IV/subchapter-B/part-422/subpart-C/section-422.116) when it is submitted to CMS for the purpose of incorporating 
into MPF. The proposed regulatory changes would further promote informed beneficiary choice and transparency found in online resources, empowering people with Medicare to 
make informed choices about their coverage. In addition, the proposal will help ensure that provider directory information, including the provider’s cultural and linguistic capabilities, which are currently required for MA provider directories, and are especially important to underserved communities, will be more readily available when
considering an MA plan.

**Cost**
This proposed changes will not affect the Medicare Trust Fund. The paperwork burden is half a million dollars annually.


### Number 17 Key provision: Promoting Community-Based Services and Enhancing Transparency of In-Home Service Contractors

CMS has become aware that some entities that provide covered benefits may not be included in an MA organization’s provider directory. These concerns relate to safety and a lack of
transparency regarding supplemental benefit service providers and their access to an enrollee’s home, as well as ensuring individuals know which providers are deeply rooted within the
communities they serve. This is particularly of concern when the enrollee may not have information about who may have access to their home, personally identifiable
information (PII), or protected health information (PHI). As such, to strengthen beneficiary protections and transparency, CMS  propose to: 
1. codify definitions of community-based organizations (CBOs), in-home or athome supplemental benefit providers and direct furnishing entities.
2. require plans to identify, within the provider directory, which providers and direct furnishing entities meet the proposed definition of a CBO.
3. require plans to identify in-home or athome supplemental benefit providers and direct furnishing entities, including those that provide a hybrid of service
(both in-home or at-home, and in-office services), either through a subset list within the provider directory or through a separate list comprising in-home or athome
supplemental benefit providers and direct furnishing entities.
4. clarify existing policy by stating that all direct furnishing entities must be included within the provider directory.

**Cost**
CMS does not expect that these proposed regulary changes will have an impact on the Medicare Trust Fund.
