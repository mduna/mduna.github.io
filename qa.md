## What is CMS MA Network Adquacy Requirements?
CMS has strict network adequacy requirements for Medicare Advantage (MA) plans, designed to ensure that enrollees have access to a sufficient number of providers and 
facilities to meet their healthcare needs. These requirements are outlined in the [Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Title 42, Part 422.116.](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-42/chapter-IV/subchapter-B/part-422/subpart-C/section-422.116)

### Key Requirements:
- **Access to Covered Services:**  
MA plans must have an adequate network of providers to ensure access to covered services, including specialists and primary care physicians.   
- **Time and Distance Standards:**  
CMS sets maximum time and distance standards for enrollees to access providers, taking into account factors like rural areas and telehealth.   
- **Minimum Number of Providers:**  
MA plans must maintain a minimum number of providers in each specialty within a specific geographic area.   
- **Provider Quality and Participation:**  
CMS requires MA plans to ensure that providers in their network are qualified and actively participating in the plan.   
- **Network Adequacy Reviews:**  
CMS conducts regular network adequacy reviews to assess whether MA plans are meeting these requirements.   

### Additional Considerations for Specific Provider Types:

- **Behavioral Health Providers:**  
CMS has specific requirements for behavioral health providers, including Clinical Psychologists and Clinical Social Workers.   
- **Telehealth Providers:**  
MA plans can receive credit towards time and distance standards for providing telehealth services from certain provider types.
