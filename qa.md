## What is CMS MA Network Adquacy Requirements?
CMS has strict network adequacy requirements for Medicare Advantage (MA) plans, designed to ensure that enrollees have access to a sufficient number of providers and 
facilities to meet their healthcare needs. These requirements are outlined in the [Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Title 42, Part 422.116.](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-42/chapter-IV/subchapter-B/part-422/subpart-C/section-422.116)

### Key Requirements:
- **Access to Covered Services:**  
MA plans must have an adequate network of providers to ensure access to covered services, including specialists and primary care physicians.   
- **Time and Distance Standards:**  
CMS sets maximum time and distance standards for enrollees to access providers, taking into account factors like rural areas and telehealth.   
- **Minimum Number of Providers:**  
MA plans must maintain a minimum number of providers in each specialty within a specific geographic area.   
- **Provider Quality and Participation:**  
CMS requires MA plans to ensure that providers in their network are qualified and actively participating in the plan.   
- **Network Adequacy Reviews:**  
CMS conducts regular network adequacy reviews to assess whether MA plans are meeting these requirements.   

### Additional Considerations for Specific Provider Types:

- **Behavioral Health Providers:**  
CMS has specific requirements for behavioral health providers, including Clinical Psychologists and Clinical Social Workers.   
- **Telehealth Providers:**  
MA plans can receive credit towards time and distance standards for providing telehealth services from certain provider types.

### Codification of CBOs and Related Entities
1. **What Does Codifying Mean in This Context?**  
Codification involves formally including definitions and requirements in the federal regulations to ensure consistency and enforceability. For this rule, codifying ensures that entities such as CBOs, in-home benefit providers, and direct furnishing entities have clear, standardized definitions and requirements.

2. **Specific Codification Proposals**  
- Definition of CBOs:  
Codify what constitutes a Community-Based Organization (CBO) to provide clarity and consistency across MA plans. A CBO is proposed to be an entity deeply embedded in local communities, offering services tailored to community needs.
- In-Home and Hybrid Providers:  
Codify the distinction between in-home, at-home, and hybrid providers who offer both in-home and in-office services.
- Direct Furnishing Entities:  
Codify that all direct furnishing entities must be included in provider directories, ensuring transparency for beneficiaries.

3. **Directory Requirements and Codification**
- Directories must clearly identify:
  - Which providers are CBOs.  
  - Providers offering in-home or hybrid services.
- This ensures beneficiaries can easily find these organizations and make informed decisions about their care.

4. **Purpose of Codification**
- To create clear, enforceable standards for including CBOs and related entities in MA provider directories.
- To strengthen transparency, safety, and equity in how services are delivered to Medicare beneficiaries.

5. **Impact of Codifying These Definitions**
- Consistency: Ensures that all MA plans adhere to the same definitions and standards.
- Transparency: Makes it easier for beneficiaries to identify and access community-focused services.
- Safety and Trust: Enhances beneficiary trust by providing accurate, standardized information about providers, particularly those offering in-home services.

### Proposed Requirements for MA Provider Directory Sharing 

1. Submission to CMS:
- MA organizations are required to submit their provider directory data to CMS to populate the Medicare Plan Finder (MPF).
- This ensures beneficiaries have access to consistent, accurate, and comprehensive provider information when evaluating MA plans.

2. Accuracy and Consistency:
- MA organizations must attest that the provider directory data:
  - Is accurate.
  - Aligns with the data submitted for CMS’s network adequacy reviews.
- This alignment is critical to prevent discrepancies between directories and network adequacy data.

3. Key Data Elements to Be Included:
- Cultural and linguistic capabilities.
- Specialties and services offered.  
This information is particularly important for underserved communities and beneficiaries with specific needs.

4. Timeline for Implementation:
- The requirement to operationalize provider directories for testing purposes is proposed to begin in **Summer 2025**.
- Full implementation is required by **October 1, 2026**, for the contract year 2026.

5. Goal of the Requirement:
- To empower beneficiaries with accurate, transparent information when choosing MA plans.
- To enhance the usability and accessibility of online resources like the MPF.  

**Benefits of the Proposed Requirement**
- Informed Decision-Making:  
Beneficiaries can better evaluate coverage options with clear and detailed provider information.
- Transparency:  
Prevents misleading or inaccurate directory data that could result in poor beneficiary experiences.
- Equity:  
Improves access to information for underserved and diverse communities by including culturally relevant details.
