## What is CMS MA Network Adquacy Requirements?
CMS has strict network adequacy requirements for Medicare Advantage (MA) plans, designed to ensure that enrollees have access to a sufficient number of providers and 
facilities to meet their healthcare needs. These requirements are outlined in the [Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Title 42, Part 422.116.](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-42/chapter-IV/subchapter-B/part-422/subpart-C/section-422.116)

### Key Requirements:
- **Access to Covered Services:**  
MA plans must have an adequate network of providers to ensure access to covered services, including specialists and primary care physicians.   
- **Time and Distance Standards:**  
CMS sets maximum time and distance standards for enrollees to access providers, taking into account factors like rural areas and telehealth.   
- **Minimum Number of Providers:**  
MA plans must maintain a minimum number of providers in each specialty within a specific geographic area.   
- **Provider Quality and Participation:**  
CMS requires MA plans to ensure that providers in their network are qualified and actively participating in the plan.   
- **Network Adequacy Reviews:**  
CMS conducts regular network adequacy reviews to assess whether MA plans are meeting these requirements.   

### Additional Considerations for Specific Provider Types:

- **Behavioral Health Providers:**  
CMS has specific requirements for behavioral health providers, including Clinical Psychologists and Clinical Social Workers.   
- **Telehealth Providers:**  
MA plans can receive credit towards time and distance standards for providing telehealth services from certain provider types.

**Regulatory Requirements**
CMS regulations at [42 CFR 422.111(b)(3)(i)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-42/chapter-IV/subchapter-B/part-422/subpart-C/section-422.111) require organizations to provide the number, mix, and distribution (addresses) of providers from whom enrollees may reasonably be expected to obtain services. This information must be provided to each enrollee in a clear, accurate, and standardized form [(42 CFR 422.111(a)(2))](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-42/chapter-IV/subchapter-B/part-422/subpart-C/section-422.111). Regulations 
at [42 CFR 422.504(a)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-42/chapter-IV/subchapter-B/part-422/subpart-K/section-422.504) and [422.504(a)(4)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-42/chapter-IV/subchapter-B/part-422/subpart-K/section-422.504) require organizations to adhere to all regulations and general instructions and to 
disclose information to beneficiaries in the manner and the form prescribed by CMS as required under [42 CFR 422.111](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-42/chapter-IV/subchapter-B/part-422/subpart-C/section-422.111). In accordance with [42 CFR 422.111(h)(2)(ii)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-42/chapter-IV/subchapter-B/part-422/subpart-C/section-422.111), each organization must post an online provider directory on its website. Section 1876 cost plan regulations at [42 CFR 417.427](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-42/chapter-IV/subchapter-B/part-417/subpart-K/section-417.427) require cost plans to adhere to the MA regulations at [42 CFR 422.111](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-42/chapter-IV/subchapter-B/part-422/subpart-C/section-422.111.

### Codification of CBOs and Related Entities
1. **What Does Codifying Mean in This Context?**  
Codification involves formally including definitions and requirements in the federal regulations to ensure consistency and enforceability. For this rule, codifying ensures that entities such as CBOs, in-home benefit providers, and direct furnishing entities have clear, standardized definitions and requirements.

2. **Specific Codification Proposals**  
- Definition of CBOs:  
Codify what constitutes a Community-Based Organization (CBO) to provide clarity and consistency across MA plans. A CBO is proposed to be an entity deeply embedded in local communities, offering services tailored to community needs.
- In-Home and Hybrid Providers:  
Codify the distinction between in-home, at-home, and hybrid providers who offer both in-home and in-office services.
- Direct Furnishing Entities:  
Codify that all direct furnishing entities must be included in provider directories, ensuring transparency for beneficiaries.

3. **Directory Requirements and Codification**
- Directories must clearly identify:
  - Which providers are CBOs.  
  - Providers offering in-home or hybrid services.
- This ensures beneficiaries can easily find these organizations and make informed decisions about their care.

4. **Purpose of Codification**
- To create clear, enforceable standards for including CBOs and related entities in MA provider directories.
- To strengthen transparency, safety, and equity in how services are delivered to Medicare beneficiaries.

5. **Impact of Codifying These Definitions**
- Consistency: Ensures that all MA plans adhere to the same definitions and standards.
- Transparency: Makes it easier for beneficiaries to identify and access community-focused services.
- Safety and Trust: Enhances beneficiary trust by providing accurate, standardized information about providers, particularly those offering in-home services.

### Proposed Requirements for MA Provider Directory Sharing 

1. Submission to CMS:
- MA organizations are required to submit their provider directory data to CMS to populate the Medicare Plan Finder (MPF).
- This ensures beneficiaries have access to consistent, accurate, and comprehensive provider information when evaluating MA plans.

2. Accuracy and Consistency:
- MA organizations must attest that the provider directory data:
  - Is accurate.
  - Aligns with the data submitted for CMS’s network adequacy reviews.
- This alignment is critical to prevent discrepancies between directories and network adequacy data.

3. Key Data Elements to Be Added:
- Cultural and linguistic capabilities.
- Specialties and services offered.  
This information is particularly important for underserved communities and beneficiaries with specific needs.

4. Timeline for Implementation:
- The requirement to operationalize provider directories for testing purposes is proposed to begin in **Summer 2025**.
- Full implementation is required by **October 1, 2026**, for the contract year 2026.

5. Goal of the Requirement:
- To empower beneficiaries with accurate, transparent information when choosing MA plans.
- To enhance the usability and accessibility of online resources like the MPF.  

**Benefits of the Proposed Requirement**
- Informed Decision-Making:  
Beneficiaries can better evaluate coverage options with clear and detailed provider information.
- Transparency:  
Prevents misleading or inaccurate directory data that could result in poor beneficiary experiences.
- Equity:  
Improves access to information for underserved and diverse communities by including culturally relevant details.
